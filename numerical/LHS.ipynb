    "## Latin hypercube sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is a statistical method for generating a near-random sample of parameter values from a multidimensional distribution. The sampling method is often used to construct computer experiments or for Monte Carlo integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "Recreate the input distribution through less samples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method:**\n",
    "- The key to this method is stratification of the input probability distribution.\n",
    "- Stratification divides the cumulative curve into equal intervals.\n",
    "- A sample is then randomly taken from each interval or \"stratification\".\n",
